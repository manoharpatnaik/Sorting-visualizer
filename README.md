# Sorting Visualizer

Welcome to the Sorting Visualizer! This project is a web-based tool that helps visualize various sorting algorithms, including Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Heap Sort, Merge Sort, and Quick Sort. The visualization makes it easier to understand how these algorithms work and how they differ from each other.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
To run this project, you need a web browser that supports HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript.

### Installation
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/sorting-visualizer.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd sorting-visualizer
   ```

3. Open `index.html` in your preferred web browser.

## Usage

1. **Adjust Array Size:**
   - Use the range slider to set the number of bars (array size) you want to visualize. The range is between 50 and 150.

2. **Set Sorting Speed:**
   - Select the speed of the sorting visualization: Slow, Medium, or Fast.

3. **Choose Sorting Algorithm:**
   - Select the sorting algorithm you want to visualize from the dropdown menu. Available options are Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Heap Sort, Merge Sort, and Quick Sort.

4. **Randomize Array:**
   - Click the "Randomize Array" button to generate a new array with random values.

5. **Start Sorting:**
   - Click the "Sort" button to start the visualization of the selected sorting algorithm.

## Features

- **Interactive Array Size Adjustment:** Easily adjust the size of the array using a range slider.
- **Multiple Sorting Algorithms:** Visualize different sorting algorithms to understand their working principles.
- **Speed Control:** Change the speed of the sorting visualization to suit your learning pace.
- **Real-time Visualization:** Watch how the sorting algorithms manipulate the array in real-time.

## Customization

### HTML
The `index.html` file contains the structure of the webpage, including the container for the bars, the controls for adjusting settings, and the links to the CSS and JavaScript files.

### CSS
The `style.css` file contains the styling for the webpage. Customize the appearance of the bars, buttons, and other elements as needed.

### JavaScript
The `sort.js` file contains the logic for the sorting algorithms and the visualization. Modify or add new algorithms to extend the functionality of the visualizer.
